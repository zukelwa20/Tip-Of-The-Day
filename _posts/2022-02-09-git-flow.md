### Git Flow

Create the project repository on github, set collaborators for the project repository you are working on. The button will look like the image below:

 Once you click the button it will show you the page to create the project repository.
 And now when you are done you will need to add collaborators.

 ``` Go to settings of your project repository once you click on it you will see this ```

 Now you can click on collaborators after you should see a green button to add collaborators.
