How to use handlebars...

```
Load the CDN(content delivery network)

Create a template inside the header using script tag.
Reference the template in js(dom logic).
Get html text using .innerHTHL.
Create the variable of your compiled template.
Inject data into the template. 
Use the keys to display. 
Remember to use the correct keys, that means use the same keys you have used to set data into the compiled template variable. 
Make sure inside of your template you do not have a code that is commented out or you have the correct syntax.
